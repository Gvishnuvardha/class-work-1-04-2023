In this program, we first prompt the user to enter a character using the printf and scanf functions. We then use a series of if statements to determine whether the character is an alphabet, digit or special character.

If the character is within the range of lowercase or uppercase alphabets, we print that it is an alphabet. If the character is a digit between 0 and 9, we print that it is a digit. If the character does not fall within either of these ranges, we print that it is a special character.
